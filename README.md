## Run with ssl sertificates
```
# Run the docker compose
docker-compose up -d --build

# Init you sertificates
# Depending on you user rights it could be that you have to give the user access to run the shell file.
# Also use staging when testing or you will have to wait for a while between each run.
# Example: chmod +x username:usergroup ./init-letsencrypt.sh
./init-letsencrypt.sh [staging | production] <domain1 domain2 ...>

```

## Run without ssl sertificates ( local testing)
```
# Run the docker compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose-without-ssl.yml up -d --build
```

## Test the stuff
